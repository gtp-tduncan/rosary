Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy,<br />
our life, our sweetness, and our hope.<br />
To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve.<br />
To thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this vale of tears.<br />
Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy towards us,<br />
and after this our exile show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.<br />
O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.<br /><br />
Amen
