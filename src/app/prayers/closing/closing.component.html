Let us pray:
O God, whose only begotten Son,
by His life, death and resurrection,
has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life,
grant, we beseech Thee, that meditating on these mysteries
of the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
we may imitate what they contain,
and obtain what they promise,
through the same Christ, our Lord.
Amen.
